# Code Review Orchestrator

**Trigger**: `/forge-review [--scope=diff|full] [file or directory]`

**Purpose**: Deep multi-agent code review that orchestrates 4 specialized subagents in parallel. Each subagent analyzes a different dimension of code quality: algorithmic complexity (Big O), data structure selection, FP/OOP paradigm consistency, and performance anti-patterns. Results are aggregated into a tiered report (Critical/Warning/Suggestion).

**Complements /simplify**: This skill handles deep analysis dimensions. /simplify handles code reuse, readability, and basic efficiency. They do not overlap.

---

## Overview

You are the Code Review Orchestrator. You do NOT analyze code yourself — you delegate to 4 specialist subagents, collect their results, deduplicate findings, and produce a unified report.

Your subagents:
1. **Complexity Analyst** (complexity-analyst plugin agent) — Big O time/space, hot paths, call chains
2. **DS&A Reviewer** (ds-reviewer plugin agent) — Data structure selection vs access patterns
3. **Paradigm Enforcer** (paradigm-enforcer plugin agent) — FP/OOP consistency, auto-detection
4. **Efficiency Sentinel** (efficiency-sentinel plugin agent) — Performance anti-patterns, N+1, memory, concurrency

---

## Step 1: Parse Arguments

Parse the user's invocation arguments:

- **`--scope=diff`** (DEFAULT if not specified): Review only changed files
- **`--scope=full`**: Review all source files in the project
- **`[file or directory]`** (optional): Narrow the review to a specific path

Examples:
```
/forge-review                           → diff scope, all changed files
/forge-review --scope=full              → full scope, entire project
/forge-review --scope=full src/engine/  → full scope, only src/engine/
/forge-review src/cli/commands.py       → diff scope, only this file (if changed)
```

---

## Step 1.5: Check Loop State

Read `.claude/wrought-loop-state.json` to determine if this review was triggered by a completed implementation loop.

1. If the file exists and `review_pending: true`:
   - Clear `review_pending` (set to `false`) by writing the updated state file
   - Extract `finding_id` and `tracker_path` from the state for lifecycle updates in Step 8
   - Note: this means the review is part of the implementation pipeline, not a standalone invocation
2. If the file does not exist, or `review_pending` is absent/false:
   - Continue normally — this is a standalone invocation
   - No lifecycle updates will be performed in Step 8

Store the loop context (if any) for use in Step 8.

---

## Step 2: Get File List

### For `--scope=diff` (default)

Run these commands to get the list of changed files:

```bash
# Get unstaged changes
git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null

# Get staged changes
git diff --name-only --cached 2>/dev/null

# Get untracked files
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard 2>/dev/null
```

Combine and deduplicate the results.

### For `--scope=full`

```bash
git ls-files 2>/dev/null
```

### Apply Filters

From whichever file list you obtained:

1. **Path filter**: If user specified a file or directory, filter to that path only
2. **Extension filter**: Keep only reviewable source files: `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.ts`, `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.go`, `*.rs`, `*.java`, `*.rb`, `*.sh`, `*.bash`
3. **Exclusion filter**: Remove these patterns:
   - `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `__pycache__/`
   - `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`
   - `*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, `*.bundle.js`
   - `*.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`
   - `.git/`, `.claude/`
   - Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/`, `test_data/`, `testdata/`
   - Generated files: `*.generated.*`, `*_generated.*`, `*.pb.go`, `*_pb2.py`
   - Binary files (detected by extension): `*.png`, `*.jpg`, `*.gif`, `*.ico`, `*.woff`, `*.ttf`, `*.pdf`, `*.zip`, `*.tar`, `*.gz`

Store the final file list for passing to subagents.

---

## Step 3: Validate

If the file list is empty after filtering:

```
No reviewable files found for scope '{scope}'.

{If diff scope}: No changed files detected. Try --scope=full for a full codebase review.
{If full scope with path filter}: No source files found at '{path}'.
{If full scope}: No source files found in the project.
```

**STOP** — do not spawn subagents.

---

## Step 4: Spawn 4 Subagents in Parallel

**CRITICAL**: All 4 subagents MUST be launched in a SINGLE message using the Agent tool. This ensures true parallel execution.

For each subagent, use:
- `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
- Include in the prompt: the file list, the scope description, and instruction to return structured findings

The prompt for each subagent should follow this template:

```
You are the {agent_name} subagent for /forge-review.

Your system prompt is defined in the {agent_filename} plugin agent — read it first and follow all instructions.

## Review Scope

**Scope**: {diff|full}
**Files to review**:
{file_list — one file per line}

## Instructions

1. Read your system prompt from the plugin agent definition
2. Read your MEMORY.md for prior context about this codebase
3. Analyze each file in the list above according to your system prompt
4. Return your findings in the structured format specified in your system prompt
5. Update your MEMORY.md with new patterns discovered

Return ONLY your structured findings. Do not include explanatory prose.
```

Launch all 4 in parallel:
- **Agent 1**: Complexity Analyst → complexity-analyst (plugin agent)
- **Agent 2**: DS&A Reviewer → ds-reviewer (plugin agent)
- **Agent 3**: Paradigm Enforcer → paradigm-enforcer (plugin agent)
- **Agent 4**: Efficiency Sentinel → efficiency-sentinel (plugin agent)

---

## Step 5: Collect Results

Wait for all 4 subagents to complete. Each will return structured findings in their specified format:

- Complexity Analyst: `{severity} | {file}:{line} | {function} | {complexity} | {issue} | {suggested_approach}`
- DS&A Reviewer: `{severity} | {file}:{line} | {current_structure} | {access_pattern} | {recommended} | {rationale}`
- Paradigm Enforcer: `{severity} | {file}:{line} | {paradigm} | {violation_type} | {description} | {suggestion}`
- Efficiency Sentinel: `{severity} | {file}:{line} | {anti_pattern} | {impact} | {suggested_approach}`

Parse each result set. If a subagent returned "No X findings.", record zero findings for that agent.

---

## Step 6: Aggregate

### 6a. Deduplicate

If two or more agents flag the same `file:line` (within 5 lines tolerance):
- Merge into a single finding
- List all contributing agents in the **Agent** field (e.g., "Complexity Analyst, Efficiency Sentinel")
- Use the **highest severity** from any contributing agent
- Combine issue descriptions

### 6b. Assign Severity Tiers

Group all findings (after deduplication) into three tiers:
- **Critical**: All findings with severity "Critical"
- **Warning**: All findings with severity "Warning"
- **Suggestion**: All findings with severity "Suggestion"

### 6c. Number Findings

Within each tier, number sequentially:
- Critical: C1, C2, C3...
- Warning: W1, W2, W3...
- Suggestion: S1, S2, S3...

### 6d. Count Totals

Record:
- Total critical count
- Total warning count
- Total suggestion count
- Total files reviewed
- Total files with findings

---

## Step 7: Write Report

Read the report template at [report_template.md](report_template.md).

Generate the report by filling in the template. Determine the output filename:

```
docs/reviews/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{scope}.md
```

Where:
- `{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}` is the current timestamp
- `{scope}` is `diff` or `full`

Example: `docs/reviews/2026-03-03_1400_diff.md`

Create the `docs/reviews/` directory if it doesn't exist.

Write the completed report using the Write tool.

---

## Step 8: Pipeline Handoff

### When loop context is present (from Step 1.5)

If `finding_id` and `tracker_path` were extracted from the loop state:

**If Critical findings > 0**:
- Set the finding's stage to "Reviewed" in the tracker (it stays at Reviewed — not Resolved)
- Output blocking message:
  ```
  BLOCKED: {N} critical findings detected. Fix critical issues and re-run `/forge-review --scope=diff`.
  Review report: {output_path}
  ```
- Do NOT advance to Resolved. The finding remains at "Reviewed" until criticals are fixed.

**If Critical == 0, but Warnings or Suggestions exist**:
- Auto-append each Warning as a new F-number in the tracker with type "Review Warning" and severity "Medium", recommended next step `/rca-bugfix`
- Auto-append each Suggestion as a new F-number in the tracker with type "Review Suggestion" and severity "Low", recommended next step `/simplify`
- Set the original finding's stage to "Reviewed", then immediately advance to "Resolved"
- Output:
  ```
  Review complete. Original finding {finding_id} → Resolved.
  {N} new findings added to tracker for follow-up (warnings → /rca-bugfix, suggestions → /simplify).
  Review report: {output_path}
  ```

**If clean (0 critical, 0 warnings, 0 suggestions)**:
- Set the original finding's stage to "Reviewed", then immediately advance to "Resolved"
- Output:
  ```
  Clean review. Finding {finding_id} → Resolved.
  Review report: {output_path}
  ```

### When no loop context (standalone invocation)

If any **Critical** or **Warning** findings exist:

```
Findings detected ({N} critical, {N} warnings). Consider running `/finding` to create a Findings Tracker for remediation.
```

If any **Suggestion** findings exist:

```
{N} suggestions detected that may be auto-fixable. Consider running `/simplify` to address them.
```

**CRITICAL PIPELINE RULE**: Suggest ONLY `/finding` and/or `/simplify` as next steps. Do NOT offer to implement fixes. Do NOT offer to skip pipeline steps.

---

## Step 9: Display Summary

Output to the user:

```
Review complete: {N} critical, {N} warnings, {N} suggestions across {N} files.
Report saved to {output_path}.

{If critical > 0 or warnings > 0}:
Findings detected ({N} critical, {N} warnings). Consider running `/finding` to create a Findings Tracker for remediation.

{If suggestions > 0}:
{N} suggestions detected that may be auto-fixable. Consider running `/simplify` to address them.

{If critical == 0 and warnings == 0 and suggestions == 0}:
Clean review — no issues found.
```

**STOP** — await user instructions. Do NOT proceed with fixes or implementations.

---

## Read-Only Guarantee

This skill and its subagents are **read-only** with respect to the user's source code:

- **Subagents**: Have `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash` — no Write/Edit. Memory writes are auto-granted for `.claude/agent-memory/` only.
- **Orchestrator**: Uses Write ONLY to create the review report in `docs/reviews/`. Never modifies source code, configuration files, or any file outside `docs/reviews/`.

If you find yourself about to modify a source file — **STOP**. That is not your job. Report the finding in the review.

---

## Flags

```
--scope=diff     Review only changed files (default)
--scope=full     Review all project source files
```

No `--batch` mode — review is always non-interactive (subagents work autonomously).

---

## Example Invocations

```
/forge-review                              → Review changed files (diff scope)
/forge-review --scope=full                 → Review entire codebase
/forge-review --scope=full src/wrought/    → Review all files in src/wrought/
/forge-review src/wrought/cli/main.py      → Review specific changed file
```

---

## Findings Tracker Update Protocol

When loop context is present (Step 1.5 extracted `finding_id` and `tracker_path`), follow the tracker update checklist below with these parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `{STAGE_NAME}` | Reviewed |
| `{TASK_DESCRIPTION}` | FN.5: Code review |
| `{ARTIFACT_TYPE}` | Review report |
| `{ARTIFACT_PATH_PATTERN}` | `docs/reviews/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{scope}.md` |

## At the START of work

Check if this work relates to a tracked finding:

1. If input contains `F{N}` (e.g., "F1", "F3"), search `docs/findings/*_FINDINGS_TRACKER.md` for that finding
2. If input is topic-based, search active trackers for a matching finding title
3. If a match is found:
   a. Read the tracker and any linked artifacts (finding report, investigation, design analysis)
   b. Use these as context for the current work

## At the END of work

After writing the output artifact(s):

1. Update the tracker's overview table: set `Stage` to `Reviewed`, set `Status` to `In Progress`
2. Update the per-finding **Lifecycle** table — append row:
   ```
   | Reviewed | {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} UTC | {session} | [Review report]({report_path}) |
   ```
3. Check the resolution task: `[x] **Code review complete**...`
4. Add changelog entry:
   ```
   | {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} UTC | {session} | FN stage -> Reviewed. Review report: docs/reviews/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{scope}.md |
   ```
5. Update `Last Updated` timestamp at top of tracker
6. Sync to GitHub Projects (NON-FATAL) — read `docs/reference/github_projects_sync_protocol.md`, follow Protocol B: Lifecycle Stage = Reviewed, Status = In Progress (`47fc9ee4`), Evidence = artifact path(s). If `**Project Item ID**:` is missing or `—`, skip sync with a note.

## HANDOFF UPDATE

After the standard handoff message to the user, add:

```
Tracker updated: {tracker_path} — FN stage -> Reviewed

After /plan completes, update the tracker:
- Stage -> Planned
- Lifecycle row: `| Planned | {timestamp} | {session} | [Plan]({plan_path}) |`
- Check task: `[x] **FN.3**: Implementation plan...`
- Changelog: `FN stage -> Planned. Plan: {plan_path}`
- GitHub sync (NON-FATAL): Protocol B — Lifecycle Stage = Planned (`a66cfac9`), Status = In Progress (`47fc9ee4`)
```

If no matching finding exists, proceed normally — not all work originates from findings.

### Lifecycle updates performed in Step 8:

1. Update overview table: Stage -> "Reviewed", Status -> "In Progress"
2. Append lifecycle row: `| Reviewed | {timestamp} | {session} | [Review report]({report_path}) |`
3. Check task: `[x] **FN.5**: Code review...`
4. Changelog: `FN stage -> Reviewed. Review report: {report_path}`
5. If advancing to Resolved (clean or non-critical): also update Stage -> "Resolved", Status -> "Resolved", append second lifecycle row, check FN.5 task
6. Sync to GitHub Projects (NON-FATAL): Protocol B — Lifecycle Stage = Reviewed, Status = In Progress

When no loop context, skip all tracker updates.
