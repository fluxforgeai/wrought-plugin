# Deep Investigation Skill

**Trigger**: Use `/investigate {incident or finding report}` when you need a thorough investigation of an incident, bug, unexpected behavior, or proactive finding.

**Input**: An incident report (from `/incident`) or a finding report (from `/finding`) describing what happened or what was found.

**Examples**:
- `/investigate Extraction hung at 12% - no error in logs, last event was url_refresh_triggered at 07:38 UTC`
- `/investigate Rate limiting errors despite batch processing - 429 responses every 2 seconds starting 14:00 UTC`
- `/investigate Health check showing red but API responding - monitor page shows Backend=red since 09:15 UTC`
- `/investigate Finding: Missing companyId filter in invoice WHERE clauses -- authorization gap`

---

## Prerequisites

Before executing this skill, verify ALL of the following:
1. **Use Glob** to check for: `docs/findings/*_FINDINGS_TRACKER.md` or `docs/incidents/*.md`
   - If NO match -> **STOP**: "Run /finding or /incident first to create an upstream artifact."
   - If user says `--force`, proceed without validation.
2. **Read** the most recent Findings Tracker matching `*_FINDINGS_TRACKER.md`
   - Identify the relevant finding (ask user if ambiguous)

## Pre-flight Check

1. Verify artifact prerequisites (above)
2. Identify which finding/workflow this is for
3. Load finding report and related artifacts for context
4. Proceed to main skill instructions

---

## Instructions

Reason thoroughly about this incident or finding. Consider all evidence, form multiple hypotheses, and test each systematically before concluding.

### Input Type Detection

Determine the input type and route accordingly:

```
IF input references a finding report (docs/findings/*.md) OR starts with "Finding:":
    -> Confirmation Mode (abbreviated investigation)
ELSE:
    -> Full Investigation Mode (standard investigation)
```

### Full Investigation Mode (incidents)

1. **Research online** for relevant documentation and known issues (search as of {current_month_year})
2. **Consult relevant API/library documentation** based on what the incident involves (search as of {current_month_year})
3. **Deeply investigate** the incident provided after `/investigate`
4. **Review past RCAs and Investigations** in `docs/RCAs/` and `docs/investigations/` to avoid repeating errors and recognize patterns
5. **Write detailed Investigation Report** to `docs/investigations/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{issue_name}.md`
6. **THEN STOP** and await further instructions

### Confirmation Mode (findings)

When a proactive finding is provided, the cause is often already known. The investigation confirms scope and validates the finding:

1. **Read the finding report** in `docs/findings/` to understand what was found
2. **Confirm the finding is real** -- reproduce or verify the evidence
3. **Determine scope** -- is it isolated or systemic?
4. **Document additional evidence** beyond what the finding captured
5. **Assess impact** -- what is the blast radius if unaddressed?
6. **Write abbreviated Investigation Report** to `docs/investigations/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{issue_name}.md`
7. **THEN STOP** and await further instructions

---

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: External Research

**Search online** (use current date context: {current_month_year}):
- Search for known issues, bugs, or limitations related to the problem
- Search for relevant API documentation updates
- Look for community discussions or Stack Overflow answers

**Consult Relevant Documentation**:

First, identify what technology/API/library the incident involves. Then search for documentation specific to that technology.

**EXAMPLES** (use these as a pattern, NOT as default searches):
- If the incident involves **Iterable**: Search "Iterable API {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **Intercom**: Search "Intercom API {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **GCS/Google Cloud Storage**: Search "Google Cloud Storage {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **httpx/requests**: Search "Python httpx {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **FastAPI**: Search "FastAPI {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"
- If the incident involves **PostgreSQL**: Search "PostgreSQL {relevant_topic} {current_month_year}"

**IMPORTANT**: Only search documentation relevant to the actual incident. Do NOT default to searching Iterable or Intercom docs unless the incident specifically involves those APIs.

From the documentation, extract:
- Rate limits, timeouts, expected behavior
- Recent API changes or deprecations
- Known limitations or gotchas

### Step 2: Gather Internal Evidence

- Search logs for relevant events
- Read related source code files
- Check recent changes that might be related
- Look for patterns in timing, data, or behavior

### Step 3: Build Timeline

Construct a precise timeline of events:
- When did the incident first appear?
- What happened immediately before?
- What was the system state?

### Step 4: Identify Root Cause

- Distinguish between symptoms and causes
- Identify primary, secondary, and contributing factors
- Trace the code path that led to the incident
- Compare our implementation against official API documentation

### Step 5: Analyze Impact

- What was affected?
- How much data/time was lost?
- What is the blast radius?

### Step 6: Review Past RCAs and Investigations (MANDATORY)

**Before recommending any fixes**, read all files in: `docs/RCAs/`, `docs/research/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/investigations/`, `docs/findings/`. Look for similar issues, prior fixes, recurring patterns, and applicable solutions.

**Document patterns found**: Has this exact or similar issue occurred before? Did a previous fix cause this? Is this a regression?

## Findings Tracker Update Protocol

## At the START of work

Check if this work relates to a tracked finding:

1. If input contains `F{N}` (e.g., "F1", "F3"), search `docs/findings/*_FINDINGS_TRACKER.md` for that finding
2. If input is topic-based, search active trackers for a matching finding title
3. If a match is found:
   a. Read the tracker and any linked artifacts (finding report, investigation, design analysis)
   b. Use these as context for the current work

## At the END of work

After writing the output artifact(s):

1. Update the tracker's overview table: set `Stage` to `Investigating`, set `Status` to `In Progress`
2. Update the per-finding **Lifecycle** table — append row:
   ```
   | Investigating | {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} UTC | {session} | [Investigation]({report_path}) |
   ```
3. Check the resolution task: `[x] **FN.1: Investigate — confirm root cause and scope**...`
4. Add changelog entry:
   ```
   | {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} UTC | {session} | FN stage -> Investigating. Investigation: {report_path} |
   ```
5. Update `Last Updated` timestamp at top of tracker
6. Sync to GitHub Projects (NON-FATAL) — read `docs/reference/github_projects_sync_protocol.md`, follow Protocol B: Lifecycle Stage = Investigating (`7ec022fd`), Status = In Progress (`47fc9ee4`), Evidence = artifact path(s). If `**Project Item ID**:` is missing or `—`, skip sync with a note.

## HANDOFF UPDATE

After the standard handoff message to the user, add:

```
Tracker updated: {tracker_path} — FN stage -> Investigating

After /plan completes, update the tracker:
- Stage -> Planned
- Lifecycle row: `| Planned | {timestamp} | {session} | [Plan]({plan_path}) |`
- Check task: `[x] **FN.3**: Implementation plan...`
- Changelog: `FN stage -> Planned. Plan: {plan_path}`
- GitHub sync (NON-FATAL): Protocol B — Lifecycle Stage = Planned (`a66cfac9`), Status = In Progress (`47fc9ee4`)
```

If no matching finding exists, proceed normally — not all work originates from findings.

## Investigation Report Template

See [report_template.md](report_template.md) for the full investigation report template.

Write to: `docs/investigations/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{issue_name}.md`

---

## After Writing the Report

### Full Investigation Mode Output

**STOP** and tell the user:

```
Investigation complete.

Report saved to: docs/investigations/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{issue_name}.md

Summary: {1-2 sentence summary}

Sources consulted:
- {List of documentation/URLs researched}

Past RCAs/Investigations/Research reviewed:
- {List of related past documents consulted}

**CRITICAL PIPELINE RULE**: Suggest ONLY the next pipeline step below. Do NOT offer `/plan` directly — that comes after `/rca-bugfix`.

Next step: Run `/rca-bugfix` with the investigation at `docs/investigations/{filename}.md` to create RCA and implementation prompt.

Do NOT add commentary suggesting any pipeline step could be skipped or is unnecessary. Awaiting your instructions.
```

### Confirmation Mode Output

**STOP** and tell the user:

```
Finding confirmed.

Report saved to: docs/investigations/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{issue_name}.md

Finding: {reference to original finding report}
Scope: {isolated | systemic | broader than expected}
Confirmed: {Yes -- real issue | Partially -- narrower than reported | No -- false positive}

**CRITICAL PIPELINE RULE**: Suggest ONLY the next pipeline step below. Do NOT offer `/plan` directly — that comes after `/rca-bugfix`.

Next step: Run `/rca-bugfix` with the investigation at `docs/investigations/{filename}.md` to create RCA and fix prompt.

Do NOT add commentary suggesting any pipeline step could be skipped or is unnecessary. Awaiting your instructions.
```

Do NOT proceed with fixes or additional work until the user responds.
