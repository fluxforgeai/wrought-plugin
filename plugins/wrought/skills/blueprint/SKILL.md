# Blueprint Procedure

**Trigger**: Use `/blueprint {feature description}` when transforming design and research output into an implementation specification and prompt for `/plan` mode.

**Examples**:
- `/blueprint CSV migration with schema drift detection`
- `/blueprint add real-time WebSocket notifications to the monitoring dashboard`
- `/blueprint migrate authentication from session-based to JWT`

## Prerequisites

Before executing this skill, verify ALL of the following:
1. **Use Glob** to check for: `docs/design/*.md`
   - If NO match -> **STOP**: "Run /design first to create a design document."
   - If user says `--force`, proceed without validation.
2. **Read** the most recent Findings Tracker matching `*_FINDINGS_TRACKER.md`
   - Identify the relevant finding (ask user if ambiguous)

## Pre-flight Check

1. Verify artifact prerequisites (above)
2. Identify which finding/workflow this is for
3. Load finding report and related artifacts for context
4. Proceed to main skill instructions

---

## Instructions

The user has described a feature or change to implement. Reason thoroughly about how to turn existing design and research artifacts into a concrete implementation specification.

**Feature to blueprint**: The argument passed after `/blueprint`

---

## CRITICAL: File Naming Convention

**ALL files MUST use this exact format**: `{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{feature_name}.md`

✅ `2026-01-27_1200_csv_migration_schema_drift.md`
❌ `BLUEPRINT_CSV_MIGRATION_2026-01-27.md` — no prefix, date comes FIRST

---

### Context Check

See [context_check.md](../_shared/context_check.md)
- Task type: "Blueprint" / Output: `docs/blueprints/`

---

## Findings Tracker Update Protocol

See [tracker_update_checklist.md](../_shared/tracker_update_checklist.md)
- Stage: "Blueprint Ready"
- Task: FN.2 (Blueprint + implementation prompt)
- GitHub field: `cf9ba762`

---

## Blueprint Analysis Process

When creating the blueprint, follow this process:

1. **Read upstream artifacts**: Check `docs/design/` and `docs/research/` for existing analysis related to the feature
1a. **Check for Design Brief**: Use Glob to check `docs/design-briefs/*.md`. If found, Read the most recent one. Reference its design tokens, typography, color system, and component patterns when specifying frontend implementation details in the blueprint. If no Design Brief exists, proceed without it.
2. **Extract requirements**: Identify what must be built from the design/research outputs (NOT diagnosing a bug — this is greenfield/proactive work)
3. **Define scope**: Clearly separate what's in-scope vs. out-of-scope
4. **Identify affected files**: List all files that will need changes
5. **Determine implementation sequence**: Order the work by dependencies
6. **Surface architecture decisions**: Document decisions already made and any that remain open
7. **Define acceptance criteria**: What does "done" look like?
8. **Identify dependencies and risks**: What could block or complicate implementation?

## Blueprint Template

When writing blueprints, use this structure:

```markdown
# Blueprint: {Feature Title}

**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Design Reference**: {path to docs/design/*.md, if any}
**Research Reference**: {path to docs/research/*.md, if any}

## Objective
{Clear statement of what will be built and why}

## Requirements
1. {Requirement 1}
2. {Requirement 2}
3. {Requirement 3}

## Architecture Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| {Decision 1} | {Choice} | {Why} |
| {Decision 2} | {Choice} | {Why} |

## Scope

### In Scope
- {Item 1}
- {Item 2}

### Out of Scope
- {Item 1}
- {Item 2}

## Files Likely Affected
- {file1.py} — {what changes}
- {file2.tsx} — {what changes}

## Implementation Sequence
1. {Step 1} — {why this order}
2. {Step 2} — {depends on step 1 because...}
3. {Step 3}

## Dependencies & Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| {Risk 1} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {How to handle} |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Criterion 1}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}
- [ ] {Criterion 3}

## Constraints
- {Constraint 1}
- {Constraint 2}

## Debug Strategy (optional — include when implementation involves testable code)
- **Self-debug**: enabled | disabled
- **Verifier**: {command} (e.g., `uv run pytest tests/ -q`)
- **Max iterations**: {N}
- **Completion criteria**: {what "done" means}
- **Escape hatch**: After {N} iterations, document blockers and request human review
- **Invoke with**: `/wrought-implement` (activates Stop hook verifier loop)
```

---

## Prompt Template

When writing prompts for `/plan` mode, use this structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Prompt: {Feature Title}

**Blueprint Reference**: docs/blueprints/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{feature_name}.md
**Design Reference**: {path to docs/design/*.md, if any}

## Context
{Brief summary of the feature and why it's being built, drawn from the blueprint}

## Goal
{What needs to be implemented}

## Requirements
1. {Requirement 1}
2. {Requirement 2}

## Files Likely Affected
- {file1.py}
- {file2.tsx}

## Implementation Sequence
1. {Step 1}
2. {Step 2}

## Constraints
- {Any constraints or considerations}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Criterion 1}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}

---

## Plan Output Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating the implementation plan, you MUST enter plan mode:

1. Call `EnterPlanMode` to enter plan mode (compresses context and enables read-only exploration)
2. Explore the codebase and design your implementation approach using read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob)
3. Write the plan to `docs/plans/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_{feature_name}.md` including:
   - Summary of the approach
   - Step-by-step implementation tasks
   - Files to modify with specific changes
   - Testing strategy
   - Rollback plan (if applicable)
4. Call `ExitPlanMode` to present the plan for user approval
5. **Wait for user approval** before proceeding to implementation
6. After plan approval, invoke `/wrought-implement` to start the autonomous implementation loop with test verification.

---

## Completion

After writing the blueprint and implementation prompt:

1. Update the Findings Tracker (per protocol above)
2. Tell the user what was produced:
   - Blueprint saved to `docs/blueprints/{name}.md`
   - Implementation prompt saved to `docs/prompts/{name}.md`
3. If context is high (>85%), note: "Context is high. Consider `/session-end`, then `/plan` in the next session."

**CRITICAL PIPELINE RULE**: Suggest ONLY the next pipeline step below. Do NOT offer to implement. Do NOT offer to skip `/plan`. Do NOT offer alternatives to the pipeline sequence.

Next step: Run `/plan` with the prompt at `docs/prompts/{name}.md` to create the implementation plan.

4. **STOP** — do NOT proceed to implementation, do NOT offer to implement. Do NOT add commentary suggesting any pipeline step could be skipped or is unnecessary. Await user instructions.
