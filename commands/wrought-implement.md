# Wrought Implement — Autonomous Implementation Loop

You are starting a Ralph Wiggum inner loop for implementation. A Stop hook will automatically verify your work after each attempt to stop.

## Step 1: Check for Active Loop

Read `.claude/wrought-loop-state.json`. If it exists and `active` is `true`:
- **WARN**: "An active loop already exists. Run `/cancel-wrought-loop` first, or continue the existing loop."
- **STOP** — do not proceed.

## Step 2: Identify the Plan

The user should provide a plan path. If not provided:
1. Use Glob to find the most recent file in `docs/plans/*.md`
2. Read it and confirm with the user: "Found plan: {path}. Proceed?"

## Step 3: Read Verifier Config

Read the `.wrought` marker file and extract:
- `verifier_type` — if `none`, ask the user: "What verifier command should I use? (e.g., `uv run pytest tests/ -q`)"
- `verifier_test_path` — default test path
- `verifier_max_loops` — iteration budget
- `verifier_timeout` — per-run timeout in seconds

## Step 4: Initialize Loop State

Write `.claude/wrought-loop-state.json`:
```json
{
  "active": true,
  "preset": "wrought-implement",
  "finding_id": "{from plan or Findings Tracker}",
  "tracker_path": "{path to active FINDINGS_TRACKER.md}",
  "verifier_command": "{verifier command}",
  "max_iterations": {from marker},
  "current_iteration": 0,
  "started_at": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "history": []
}
```

## Step 5: Implement

1. Read the implementation plan thoroughly
2. Implement changes step by step, following the plan's sequence
3. After implementing, the Stop hook will automatically run the verifier
4. If the verifier fails, you will be blocked — analyze the error output and fix
5. Continue until all tests pass

## Step 6: Completion

When the loop completes (verifier passes):
1. Read the final `.claude/wrought-loop-state.json` to summarize iterations
2. Report: "Implementation complete after {N} iterations. Capsule artifacts at `docs/capsules/{finding_id}/`"
3. Update the Findings Tracker with implementation status
4. Suggest: "Tests pass. Next: run `/forge-review --scope=diff` to verify code quality."
